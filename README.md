CARMA python and Bash Routines Archive

This is intended to be a collection of user-friendly and 'generalised' routines for the running of the CARMA (strictly speaking ExoCARMA) program, and the post processing and plotting of its output.

Here will list the individual routines that have so far been addded. Individual routines will be contained in their own folders and contain their own readme.

1) 2DCARMA_Plotting: python3 routine to take the standard output (not the flux, rates, or diag files) from 2DCARMA runs, and produce plots of the data. (ATM this is just 2D contour plots of the time averaged number density.)
